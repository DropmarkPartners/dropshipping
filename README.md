Integrating Pages
As a developer, you can integrate Builder into your codebase and give other team members, such as content editors, marketers, and designers the ability to build and manage pages without ever having to ping you.

This document shows you how to connect the Builder.io drag-and-drop page building UI to your existing app. If you don't have an app already, you can use the Builder CLI to quickly generate one.


Tip: This guide is step-by-step. If you'd prefer a more succinct guide to integrating, see Developer Quickstart, which is a cheatsheet version of this document.

Create an app if you don't have one

Tip: We highly recommend that you integrate Builder into an existing app; however, if you need to create an app, follow the steps for your framework in this section.

REST API
You can integrate directly with Builder's HTML API instead of using an SDK. Builder pre-renders your content on its servers and provides the HTML for download, which you can insert into your page.

Create a catchall route in your back-end that downloads the pre-rendered HTML, inserts it onto the page, and responds to the client request with the page. You can use whichever framework you like.

The example app below uses Node.js, Express, and Axios. Copy and paste it into a new file named index.js and make sure that you have Node and Express installed in your development environment.

const express = require('express');

const app = express();
// Replace with your Public API Key.
const apiKey = YOUR_API_KEY;
const port = 3000;

const handleError = err => {
  // The requested Builder content could not be found.
  if (err.response.status === 404) {
    return { data: null };
  }
  throw err;
};

// Catchall route
app.get('*', async (req, res) => {
  const encodedUrl = encodeURIComponent(req.url);
  const { data: pageData } =
    await fetch(`https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/html/page?apiKey=${apiKey}&url=${encodedUrl}`)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .catch(handleError);

  if (pageData) {
    const pageHtml = pageData.html;

    res.send(`
      <html>
        <head> <!-- Your head content here --> </head>
        <body>
           ${pageHtml}
        </body>
      </html>
    `);
  } else {
    res.status(404);
    res.send(/* Your 404 page HTML */);
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
